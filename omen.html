        OMEN
    </h1>
    <p>
        Omen is a phantom of a man with mysterious origins and many names. He has a limited memory of his past, though he does remember being involved in something that caused him to be ripped apart and killed. All he knows that links to who he used to be is a place known as Point Light, a past friendship with Sabine "Viper" Callas, and feelings of restoration with every kill he makes. Contributing to the formation of the VALORANT Protocol, Omen would go on to become its third recruit and serve as one of its more experienced agents, all while he continues his search for answers about what truly happened to him over a decade ago.
        A living nightmare, Omen takes full advantage of his shadowed physique and will not hesitate to eliminate his enemies using the forces of paranoia and fear. He is cynical in nature, which stems from him experiencing extreme pain as he was condemned to remain in the state that he is today. If there's one person who wants to know more about his mysterious circumstances, it's Omen himself - and quite desperately so.

Despite his fearsome nature, Omen shows some friendliness towards people he knows well such as Viper, shown by being able to call her by her real name despite her warning other agents to never do so. He has been known to knit as a way to help him focus.
