        KILLJOY
    </h1>
    <p>
        Klara Böhringer is an inventor from Germany who was born to one parent with Germanic ancestry. A nominee for the Distinguished Inventor award, Böhringer became the lead for Kingdom's R&D department at the age of 18. Incredibly successful, she had many breakthroughs during her time at Kingdom with several of her creations and innovations.[1]

Böhringer was the fourth agent to join the VALORANT Protocol as "Killjoy". She earned her call sign after her team initially used it to compliment her outstanding skills that reduced the amount of work the rest of them had to do, with Klara deciding to keep the nickname. Killjoy now continues her innovative work as an agent of VALORANT and the protégé of the organization's commander, Brimstone. From inventing spike defusers under pressure of an incoming detonation to building teleporters for transportation between worlds, any device the Protocol needs for any purpose - with the right tools, Killjoy can make it.
The epitome of German efficiency, Killjoy always shows excitement at the opportunity of being able to use the technology she builds to its fullest extent, as well as the chance to retrieve additional knowledge. Always ambitious in her work, Killjoy has shamelessly admitted that she has a history of exploiting tech-related missions in order to "weasel more money" out of the Protocol's quarterly budget.

While she describes herself as "cool as a cucumber," Killjoy grows frustration whenever she sees her teammates not participating alongside her requests such as testing new tech or reading the data reports she has written. Nevertheless, she is fully confident in her own genius, as seen when she tells her teammates (particularly the tech users) to entrust their gadgets for her to fix, and when she reminds the team to leave the overthinking to her.

A glimpse of her sympathetic nature was shown in a voicemail sent to Brimstone wherein she expressed sadness over the loss of non-military lives following the destruction of the Everett-Linde Laboratory.
