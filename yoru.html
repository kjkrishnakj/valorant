    <h1>
        YORU
    </h1>
    <p>
        A radiant from Tokyo, Japan, Ryo Kiritani (Japanese: 桐谷 諒) is a man dedicated to uncovering his past. Specifically interested in his ancestors and an ancient order of samurai, Kiritani's search has kept on bringing him to Kingdom's S22 container port. On his first visit, he broke into the facility and stole a mask from a set of samurai armor that allowed him to see into another dimension. He was later recruited by the VALORANT Protocol as its fifteenth agent, "Yoru", and shortly after this his familiarity with S22 saw him returning there on assignment to prevent a spike detonation by hostiles from Omega Earth.[1][2]

Still not done with S22 however, Yoru continued to return to the site despite having other missions to do for the Protocol and against the advice of his superiors. His research led him to discovering new information relating to both radianite and the alternate dimension that he could access and enter with his powers. Finding a part of the ship with older dimensional fabric, Yoru suddenly fell through into a space that felt as if he was traveling from "now to then". He pushed forward as far as he could and heard a woman's voice calling out to him, one he thought he recognized, but before he could answer back, the rift closed.

Left with even more questions, Yoru continues his research whilst serving as an agent of VALORANT, and hopes one day the Protocol's leadership will see the value in looking into these events along with him.
Personality
Yoru has spiked hair with two shades of blue, one light and the other being much darker. He sports a black ear piercing on the lobe of either ear, and he has a slit on his left eyebrow. The most notable part of his uniform is his unique blue jacket that has two spikes on both shoulders, an orange insignia depicting a skull imprinted on the shoulders, and his logo that bears resemblance to a wolf embedded on the back. He also wears black pants and a pair of black shoes.

When Yoru activates his ultimate ability, he dons a samurai mask that bears an illustration of a mouth with two fangs.
